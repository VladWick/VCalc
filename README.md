# VCalc 0.6
---------------------------------------
Handy calculator with useful features for math students.

<i>Version: 0.6 </i> <br>

<h2>Description</h2>
This programm is written in Java using Swing.

<h3>Standart</h3> 
	&emsp; Just average simple calculator with usual actions 
<h3>Scientific</h3> 
	&emsp; Extended Calc with doubled functionality
<h3>Derivatives</h3>
	&emsp; Find the derivative of a function if the function itself is in user's input 
<h3>Integrals</h3>
	&emsp;Find indefinite integral of a function if the function itself is in user's input<br>
	
"Standart" and "Scientific" provide a whole bunch of buttons. Press on button - means change text in JLabel.
It means that you can not paste expression and find an answer. You need type it. 

Derivatives and Integrals provide JTextField in which you can paste expression and then, after clicking on "Find Derivative/Integral", you can get an answer in the botton field.
	
---------------------------------------
<h2>UPDATE VCalc0.2</h2>
&emsp; - Better readability and architecture now because less classes<br>
&emsp; - Dark and white mode move to another new class called "Design"<br>
&emsp; - Move switching classes to the "Design"<br>
&emsp; - Made a Calc with the same functionality. but with one operation at a time in StandartCalc<br>

---------------------------------------
<h2>UPDATE VCalc0.3</h2>
&emsp; - Update whole programm with the ideas of "Clean Code" <br>
&emsp; - all classes is divided into functions in a right and readable way  <br>
&emsp; - all the design details into the class "Design" => dark and white mode  <br>
&emsp; - less comments - better code layout  <br>

---------------------------------------
<h2>UPDATE VCalc0.4</h2>
&emsp; - flawless Standart<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; whole a bunch of bugs is fixed<br>
&emsp; - full support of Scientific<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; added new entity = functions<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Scientific inherit everything from Standart and extend it<br>

---------------------------------------
<h2>UPDATE VCalc0.5</h2>
&emsp; - Standart`s and Scientific`s ActionListener classes was rebuild in more readable and accessable way.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  <br>
&emsp; - Make Derivatives from scratch <br>
&emsp; - Delete basic table derivatives <br>
&emsp; - Insted of it full support derivatives of three types of polynoms <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; C*x^(number) <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; C*(x-a)^(number) <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; C*(B*x-a)^(number) <br>
&emsp; - And all their combinations/sums <br>

---------------------------------------
<h2>UPDATE VCalc0.6</h2>
&emsp; - Make Integrals from scratch <br>
&emsp; - Delete basic table integrals <br>
&emsp; - Insted of it full support integrals of three types of polynoms <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; C*x^(number) <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; C*(x-a)^(number) <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; C*(B*x-a)^(number) <br>
&emsp; - And all their combinations/sums <br>
